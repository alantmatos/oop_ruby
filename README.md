 -------------------- Encapsulation --------------------


Encapsulation is important not only to make it clear which object is responsible for what information, but also to make objects less dependent or coupled to each other. Closely coupled objects make it difficult for a system to evolve since changing a single class can have many side effects on any other method that uses instances of that type.
