Inheritance



 Inheritance allows the programmer to inherit the characteristics of one class into another class.

 Inheritance provides the concept of “reusability”, i.e. If a programmer wants to create a new class and there is a class that already includes some of the code that the programmer wants, then he or she can derive a new class from the existing class. By doing this, it increases the reuse of the fields and methods of the existing class without creating extra code.
