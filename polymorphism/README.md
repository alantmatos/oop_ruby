Polymorphism


Polymorphism is a made up of two words Poly which means Many and Morph which means Forms. So Polymorphism is a method where one is able to execute the same method using different objects. In polymorphism, we can obtain different results using the same function by passing different input objects. One can also write the If-Else commands but that just makes the code more lengthy. To avoid this, the programmers came up with the concept of polymorphism.
